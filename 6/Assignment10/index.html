      <h2>But what about the roads?</h2>
      <p>
        You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry
        kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply; we'll all have our roads.

      <h2>Is taxation theft?</h2>
      <p>
        If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you
        and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some
        crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?

      <h2>So, what you're saying is...?</h2>
      <p>
        Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy
        fields with fully automatic weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
        A world where voluntarism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
